HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language

HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages

HTML describes the structure of a Web page

HTML consists of a series of elements

HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content

HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.


<!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title></title>
        </head>
        <body>

        </body>
</html>


HTML Headings

HTML Images

HTML Images are defined with the <img> tag.

The source file (src) ,  alternative (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes.


An HTML element is defined by starting a tag, some content, and an end tag.

HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag.

HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements

All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional  information about elements.
Attributes are always specified in the start tag.
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

href attributes specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.

src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed.

There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website.

Tip: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page.

Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will nto break if you change domain.


img tag - width, height, style & alt attributes

style attribute - used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

lang attribute - inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.

title - defines some extra information about an element. Title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element.

Headings are important
Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.

<h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on.

<html>       - Defines the root of ana HTML document
<body>       - Defines teh document's body
<h1> to <h6> - Defines the HTML headings.
<p>          - Defines a paragraph.

- <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as horizontal rule.

HTML Line Breaks

- <br> element defines a line break.


- <pre> element defines preformatted text.
- The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width format (usually Courier), and it preserved both spaces and line breaks.

<p>	Defines a paragraph
<hr>	Defines a thematic change in the content
<br>	Inserts a single line break
<pre>	Defines pre-formatted text


style - is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font size, and more.


Use the style attribute for styling HTML elements
Use background-color for background color
Use color for text colors

HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.


<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text
<small> - Smaller text
<del> - Deleted text
<ins> - Inserted text
<sub> - Subscript text
<sup> - Superscript text

strong is used to mean that you are trying to emphasize those words strongly, and that is the structure of what you want to write. But <b> is used for styling text to be bold, which can be done with CSS, and CSS can override the appearance of <strong> also

strong is screen reader compatible and has a semantic significance.
